/**
 * Notification Worker (Stub)
 * 
 * This is a placeholder for the notification worker system.
 * Currently not in use - notifications are handled directly via Socket.io
 * 
 * If you need to implement a worker system in the future:
 * 1. Install BullMQ: npm install bullmq ioredis
 * 2. Set up Redis connection
 * 3. Create worker to process queue jobs
 * 4. Handle job processing and errors
